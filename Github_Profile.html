          Jesse Brown is an American musician, sound engineer, producer, and computer programmer residing in Culver City, California. Born on February 10th 1985 to a musically inclined family, he was destined to be heavily influenced by it. He started piano lessons at age 10, and at 16 he decided he wanted a carreer in the music industry. So he borrowed an electric bass and amp from his grandma to join his first band with some friends. Fast forward a handful of bands, a few recording sessions, some touring, and a bachelor's in Music Production, he is ready to put the sum of his talents together and make his mark on the world.
